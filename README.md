# amazon-book-data-scraper
Package that allows the extraction of information about a book on Amazon.com using its ISBN.

Currently it only supports the use of Google Chrome.

## How to use
You will need to download the latest [chromedriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)
and place it inside the project folder.

If the Chromedriver is not found, an exception will be thrown and a message will appear telling you the path where it should be placed.

### Using as a library
Download or build the ``.jar`` and include it in your project as a library, then you can use any of the classes of the project.

## Documentation

on your preferred browser.
